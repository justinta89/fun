## Create the database
_Scripts courtesy of Miguel Grinberg, from the Flask Mega-Tutorial http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database_
Create the database by running `db_create.py`

Whenever changes are made, `db_migrate.py` will
make the necessary changes without having to
recreate the DB.
